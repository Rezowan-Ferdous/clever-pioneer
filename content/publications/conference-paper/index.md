abstract: Masked face detection is a challenging task due to the occlusions created by the masks. Recent studies show that deep learning models can achieve effective performance for not only occluded faces but also for unconstrained environments, illuminations or various poses. In this study, we have addressed the problem of occlusion due to wearing masks in masked face detection technique in deep transfer learning method. We have also reviewed the recent deep learning models for face detection and considered VGG16, VGG19, MobileNet and DenseNet as our underlying masked face detection models. Moreover, we have prepared a dataset containing masked face and without mask from 120 individuals and enhanced the dataset using augmentation. After training the deep learning models with our own dataset, we have analysed the performance of the deep learning models for several types of loss functions. From the experiment, it is clear that all the deep learning models perform well in terms of classification losses like categorical cross entropy loss and KL divergence loss.
